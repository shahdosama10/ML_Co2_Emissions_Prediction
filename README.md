# CO2 Emissions Prediction Project


This project analyzes vehicle data to predict CO2 emissions and classify emission levels. Using linear and logistic regression models, this project provides insights into the environmental impact of vehicles and helps in making data-driven decisions to combat climate change.

## Project Features

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Detect missing values and ensure data completeness.
   - Visualize relationships between features with pairplots and correlation heatmaps.
   - Check and standardize the scale of numeric features.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encode categorical features and targets.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Scale numeric features for better model performance.

3. **Linear Regression**:
   - Implement linear regression from scratch using gradient descent.
   - Select optimal features based on correlation analysis.
   - Visualize cost reduction during gradient descent iterations.
   - Evaluate the model with the RÂ² score.

4. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Predict emission classes using stochastic gradient descent.
   - Use the same features as in the linear regression model for consistency.
   - Evaluate model accuracy on the test dataset.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Histogram-based pairplots for feature relationships.
   - Heatmaps to identify correlations between variables.

6. **Environmentally Conscious Insights**:
   - Understand how vehicle features impact CO2 emissions.
   - Classify vehicles based on their emission levels for informed decision-making.
